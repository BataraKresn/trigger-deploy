# üéâ Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed Infinite Redirect Loop
- **Problem**: Dashboard was stuck in redirect loop at https://dev-trigger.mugshot.dev/
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved redirect logic in `src/routes/main.py`
  - Added proper session handling in authentication
  - Added explicit request path checking to prevent loops

### ‚úÖ 2. Fixed API Error `/api/services/status`
- **Problem**: `'str' object has no attribute 'get'` error
- **Solution**:
  - Improved services JSON parsing in `src/utils/service_monitor.py`
  - Added support for both old and new service file formats
  - Added better error handling for invalid JSON

### ‚úÖ 3. Created Example Services Configuration
- **Problem**: No example services.json to populate dashboard cards
- **Solution**:
  - Created `/workspaces/trigger-deploy/static/services.json` with example services
  - Updated configuration to use static/services.json instead of config/services.json
  - Added icons and proper service descriptions

### ‚úÖ 4. Fixed Logout Functionality
- **Problem**: Could not logout, stuck in refresh loop
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper logout GET and POST routes in `src/routes/main.py`
  - Improved session management in `src/utils/auth.py`
  - Added logout handling in JavaScript

### ‚úÖ 5. Improved Dashboard UI
- **Problem**: Poor visual layout, no cards, no status indicators

  - Added statistics dashboard with real-time updates
  - Created modern service monitoring JavaScript
  - Added mobile-friendly responsive layout

### ‚úÖ 6. Fixed Database Issues
